# Unvanquished translation string generator

`generate_pot.sh` is the entry point. It generates the .po files containing the strings from the
source code that need to be translated from English to other languages. These are uploaded somehow
to the translation tool hosted at https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/unvanquished/unvanquished/
