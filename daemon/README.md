‚ÑπÔ∏è We provide ready-to-use downloads for the Unvanquished game on the Unvanquished [download page](https://unvanquished.net/download/), builds of the D√¶mon engine are included.

‚ÑπÔ∏è The repository of the source code for the game logic of Unvanquished can be found [there](https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished).

## Workspace requirements

To fetch and build D√¶mon, you'll need:
`git`,
`cmake`,
and a C++11 compiler.

The following are actively supported:
`gcc` ‚â• 4.8,
`clang` ‚â• 3.5,
Visual Studio/MSVC (at least Visual Studio 2019).

## Dependencies

Required:
`zlib`,
`libgmp`,
`libnettle`,
`libcurl`,
`SDL2`,
`GLEW`,
`libpng`,
`libjpeg` ‚â• 8,
`libwebp` ‚â• 0.2.0,
`Freetype`,
`OpenAL`,
`libogg`,
`libvorbis`,
`libopus`,
`libopusfile`.

Optional:
`ncurses`.

### MSYS2

Also required:
`base-devel`.

64-bit: `mingw-w64-x86_64-{toolchain,cmake}`,  
_or_ 32-bit: `mingw-w64-i686-{toolchain,cmake}`.

MSYS2 is an easy way to get MingW compiler and build dependencies, the standalone MingW on Windows also works.

## Downloading the sources for the game engine

Daemon requires several sub-repositories to be fetched before compilation. If you have not yet cloned this repository:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Daemon.git
```

If you have already cloned:

```sh
cd Daemon/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è If cmake complains about missing files in `libs/crunch/` folder or similar issue then you have skipped this step.

## Build Instructions

üí°Ô∏è Instead of `-j4` you can use `-jN` where `N` is your number of CPU cores to distribute compilation on them. Linux systems usually provide a handy `nproc` tool that tells the number of CPU core so you can just do `-j$(nproc)` to use all available cores.

Enter the directory before anything else:

```sh
cd Daemon/
```

### Visual Studio

  1. Run CMake.
  2. Choose your compiler.
  3. Open `Daemon.sln` and compile.

### Linux, macOS, MSYS2

Produced files will be stored in a new directory named `build`.

```sh
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build -- -j4
```

### Linux cross-compile to Windows

üí°Ô∏è For a 32-bit build use the `cross-toolchain-mingw32.cmake` toolchain file instead.

```sh
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/cross-toolchain-mingw64.cmake
cmake --build build -- -j4
```

## Running a game

‚ÑπÔ∏è On Windows you'll have to use `daemon.exe` and `daemonded.exe` instead of `./daemon` and `./daemonded`, everything else will be the same.

To run a game you would need a `pkg/` folder full of `.dpk` files provided by the D√¶mon-based game you want to run. This `pkg/` folder has to be stored next to the `daemon` binary.

You then run the game this way:

```
./daemon
```

If you want to run a dedicated server, you may want to use the non-graphical `daemonded` server binary and start a map this way:

```
./daemonded +map <mapname>
```

Map names and other options may be [specific to the game](https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished#configuring-the-server).
